Step 1
Start by setting up your HTML structure. Add a <!DOCTYPE> declaration and
an html element with a lang attribute set to en. Within the html element,
add a head element and a body element.

Step 2
Within your head element, add a meta tag with the charset attribute set to
utf-8. Also add a title element with the text Picasso Painting.

Step 3
Go ahead and link your CSS file now, even though you have not written any
CSS yet.
Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet and an href of
styles. css .

Step 4
FontAwesome is a library of SVG-powered icons, many of which are freely
available to use. You will be using some of these icons in this project, so
you will need to link the external stylesheet to your HTML.
Add a link element with a rel of stylesheet and an href of
https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css .

Step 5
To get your painting started, give your body element a background-color
of rgb(184, 132, 46).

Step 6
Within your body tag, add a div element. Give it an td of back-wall .

Step 7
Use an id selector to give the element with the id back-wall a
background-color of #884513.

Step 8
Give the *back-wall element a width of 100% and a height of 60%.

Step 9
Typically, HTML is rendered in a top-down manner. Elements at the top of the
code are positioned at the top of the page. However, many times you may want
to move the elements to different positions. You can do this with the position
property.
Set the posttton property for the #back-wall element to absolute. An
absolute position takes the element out of that top-down document flow and
allows you to adjust it relative to its container.
When an element is manually positioned, you can shift its layout with top,
left, right, and bottom. Set the *back-wall element to have a top value of
o, and a left value of ø.

step lø
The z- index property is used to create "layers" for your HTML elements. If you
are familiar with image editing tools, you may have worked with layers before.
This is a similar concept.
Elements with a higher z-tndex value will appear to be layered on top of
elements with a lower z- index value. This can be combined with the
positioning in the previous lesson to create unique effects.
Since the back-wall element will need to appear "behind" the other elements
you will be creating, give the back-wall element a z-tndex of -1.

Step 11
Below your #back-wall element, create a div with a class of characters.
This is where you will be creating your painting's characters.

step 12
Inside that . characters element, create another div with an td of offwhite-
character.

step 13
Create four div elements inside your offwhtte-character element. Give
those div elements the following td values, in order white-hat, black-mask,
gray-tnstrument, tan-table.

Step 14
This character needs eyes. Create two div elements in the *black-mask
element. Give them the classes eyes left and eyes right, in that order.

step 15
Create some "dots" for the instrument. Add five div elements within your
#gray-tnstrument element. Set the class of each to black-dot.

Step 16
Using an id selector, create a rule for the element with the id offwhtte-
character. Give it a width of 3øøpx,a height of 550px, and a background-
color of GhostWhtte .

Step 17
Move the #0ffwhtte-character into place by giving it a posttton of
absolute, a top value of 20%, and a left valueof 17.5%.

Step 18
Using an id selector, style the element with the id white-hat . Give it a width
and height of 0, and a border-style of solid.

Step 19
That does not look quite right. Set a border-width of 12øpx 140px
18øpx to size the hat properly.

step 20
Now you have a large box. Give it a border-top-color, border-right-color ,
and border-left-color of transparent. Set the border-bottom-color to
GhostWhtte . This will make it look more like a hat.

Step 21
Give the hata posttton of absolute, a top value of -14øpx, and a left
value of o.

step 22
Using an id selector, create a rule for the element with the id black-mask.
Give ita width of 100%, a height of 5øpx, and a background-color of
rgb(45, 31, 19).

step 23
Give the mask a position of absolute, and a top and left value of o.

step 24
To ensure you can see the mask, give ita z-index of 1.

step 25 e
Using an id selector, give the element with the id gray-tnstrument a
width of 15%, a height of 40%, and a background-color of rgb( 167,
162, 117).

step 26
Now move it into place with a position of absolute, a top value of 50px,
and a left value of 125px.

step 27
Set the z-tndex to 1.

Step 28
Use a class selector to create a rule for the elements with black-dot
class. Set the width to løpx, the height to 10px, and the background-
color to rgb(45, 31, 19).

step 29
These dots are just a little too square. Give the black-dot class a border-
radius of to fix it.

step 30 e
Move the dots into place by setting the display to block, the margtn to
auto, and the margin-top to 65%.

Step 31
Use an id selector to style the element with the id tan-table. Give it a
width of 45øpx,a height of 140px, and a background-color of
#D2691E .

step 32
Move the table into place by giving ita position of absolute, a top value
of 275px, and a left value of 15px.

step 33
Give the table a z-tndex of 1.

Step 34
After your dtv#0ffwhtte-character element, add a dtv with the td of
black-character.

step 35
Within your new *black-character element, add three div elements with
the following td values, in order black-hat, gray-mask, white-paper.

step 36
The mask needs eyes. Within your #gray-mask element, add two dtv
elements. The first should have the class set to eyes left, and the
second should have the class set to eyes right.

step 37
Time to use some FontAwesome icons.
The element is used for idiomatic text, or text that is separate from the
"normal" text content. This could be for italic text, such as scientific terms, or for
icons like those provided by FontAwesome.
Within your #whtte-paper element, add four t elements. Give them all a
class valueof fas fa-mustc.
This special class is how FontAwesome determines which icon to load. fas
indicates the category of icons (FontAwesome Solid, here), while fa-mus tc
selects the specific icon.

step 38
Use an id selector to create a rule for the element with the id black-
character. Set the width to 300px, the hetght to 50øpx, and the
background-color to rgb(45, 31, 19).

Step 39
Move the #black-character element into place by setting the posit ton to
absolute, the top to 30%, and the left to 59%.

Step 40
Use an id selector to create a rule for the element with the id black-hat. Give it
a width of ø,a height of 0, and a border-style of solid.

Step 41
Set the border-width of the #black-hat to 15øpx ø ø 300px.

Step 42
Just like with your *white-hat , you should style the border for the *black-hat
element. Give it a border-top-color, border-rtght-color, and border-
bottom-color of transparent. Set the border-left-color to rgb(45, 31,
19).

Step 43
Now position the #btack-hat element. Give ita posttton of absolute,
with a top of -15øpx and a left of O.

Step 44
Using an id selector, style the element with the id gray-mask. Give it a
width of 150px, a height of 150px, and a background-color of
rgb( 167, 162, 117).

step 45
Position the #gray-mask element by setting position to absolute, the
top to -10px, and the left to 7øpx.

Step 46
Using an id selector, create a rule for the id white-paper. Set the width
to 4øøpx, the height to leøpx, and the background-color to
GhostWhtte.

step 47
Give the *white-paper a position of absolute, a top of 25øpx, and a
left of -150px to move it into place.

Step 48
Set the z-tndex of the #whtte-paper element to 1.

step 49
FontAwesome icons come with their own styling to define the icon.
However, you can still set the styling yourself as well, to change things
like the color and size. For now, use a class selector to target the icons
with the class fa-mustc . Set the display to inline-block, the
margin-top to 8%, and the margin-left to 13%.

Step 50
Below your *black-character element, add two new div elements.
These will be the shawl. Give both of them a class of blue. Then give the
first one an td of blue-left, and the second an td of blue-right.

Step 51
Use a class selector to target the new elements with the class blue. Set
the background-color to #1E9ØFF.

Step 52
Select the element with the id blue-left using an id selector. Give it a
width of 5øøpx and a height of 3øøpx.

step 53
Now set the posit ton to absolute, the top to 2B, and the left to

Step 54
Next, target the element with the id blue-rtght using an id selector. Set
the width to 4øøpx and the height to 3øøpx.

step 55
Give the #blue-rtght element the correct positioning with position set
to absolute, top set to 50%, and left set to 40%.

step 56
Below your . blue elements, add another div. Give it the td value of
orange-character .

step 57
Within that #orange-character element, add four div elements. Give
them the td values of black-round-hat, eyes-dtv, triangles, and
guitar, in order.

step 58
The #eyes-dtv element should hold some eyes. Add two div elements
inside. Give the first a class of eyes left, and give the second a class
of eyes right.

Step 59
Within the #trtangles div, you will need to add the elements that will
become your triangles. Create thirty d tv elements and give each of them
the class triangle.

Step 60
Within the #guttar element, create three div elements. Give the first two
a class value of guitar. Then give the first an td of guitar-left, and
the second an td of guitar-right. Add an td tothe third dtv with the
value guitar-neck.
The third div should not have the guttar class.

step 61
Use another FontAwesome icon for your . guitar. Inside both the
*guitar-left and *guitar-right elements, add an t element and give
ita class of fas fa-bars.

step 62
Select your orange-character element with an id selector. Give it a
width of 25øpx,a height of 55øpx, and a background-color of
rgb(24ø, 78, 42).

step 63
Give the #orange-character element a position of absolute, a top of
25%, and a left of 40%.

Step 64
Style the element with the id black-round-hat using an id selector. Set
the width to 180px, the height to 150px, and the background-color to
rgb(45, 31, 19).

Step 65
The #btack-round-hat element should probably be round. Give it a
border-radius of 50% to fix this.

step 66
Move the *black-round-hat element into place with a posit ton of
absolute, a top of -løøpx,anda left of 5px.


step 67
Put the *black-round-hat element on the correct layer with a z-tndex
of -1.

step 68
Use an id selector to create a rule for the element with the id eyes-div.
Set the width to 18øpx and the height to 5øpx.

step 69
Now move the *eyes-div element into position with position set to
absolute, top set to -4øpx, and left set to 2øpx.

Step 70
Give the #eyes-dtv element a z-tndex of 3.

Step 71
Target the element with the id trtangles using an id selector. Set the
wtdth to 250px and the height to 550px.

step 72
Create a class selector for the elements with the triangle class. Set the
width to and the height to O.

step 73
Style the border of your . trtangle elements. Set the border-style to
solid and the border-width to 42px 45px 45px 0 .

Step 74
Give your . triangle elements the correct color. Set the border-top-
color, border-bottom-color, and border-left-color to
transparent. Set the border-right-color to Gold .

step 75
Adjust the layout of the . triangle elements with a display of inline-
block.

step 76
Now use an id selector for guitar. Set the width to 100%, and the
height to løøpx.

Step 77
In the same #guttar selector, set the post t ton to absolute, the top to
12øpx, and the left to øpx.

step 78
Give the *guitar rule a z-tndex of 3.

step 79
Now use a class selector to target guitar. This will style the two "halves"
of your guitar. Set the width to 15øpx, the height to 12øpx, the
background-color to Goldenrod, and the border-radius to 50%.

Step 80
Select the td with value guttar-left, and set the posttton to
absolute and the left to øpx .

Step 81
Select the td with value guitar-right, and also set position to
absolute. This time, set left to løepx.

step 82
Now you need to move the bar icons into place. Create a class selector
for the fa-bars class. Set the display to block, the margtn-top to
30%, and the margin-left to 40%.

step 83
Use an id selector to create a rule for the id guitar-neck. Set the width
to 2øøpx, the height to 30px, and the background-color to #D2691E.

Step 84
Now move the #guttar-neck element with a posttton of absolute, a
top value of 45px, and a left value of 2øøpx.

step 85
Give the *guitar-neck element a z-tndex of 3.

Step 86
Time to style the elements with the eyes class. Use a class selector to
set the width to 35px, the height to 20px, the background-color to
#884513, and the border-radius to 2øpx 50%.

step 87
Target the class with value right and setthe position to absolute,
top to 15px, and right to 30px.

Step 88
For the class with value left, create the selector and set the posit ton
to absolute, the top to 15px, and the left to 3øpx.

step 89
One last step. The FontAwesome icons are a little too small. Target all of
them with a class selector for fas, and set the font-size to 30px.
With that, your Picasso painting is complete!
