Step 1
Begin with your standard HTML boilerplate. Add a DOCTYPE declaration, an
html element specifying this page is in English, a head element, and a body
element.
Add a <meta> tag with the appropriate charset and a <meta> tag for
mobile responsiveness within the head element.

step 2
Add a title element with the text Magazine, a ltnk element for the
https://fonts.googleapts.com/css?
font
stylesheet, a ltnk for the
https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.8.2/css/all.css
FontAwesome stylesheet, and a link for your ./styles. css stylesheet.
Your font stylesheet will load three separate fonts: Anton, Baskervville,
 and Raleway.

step 3
Within your body, create a main element. Then in that element, create a
section with a class set to heading.

Step 4
Within your . heading element, create a header element with the class set
to hero.
In that element, create an img element with the src set to
https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/untversal/fcc_meta_192Ã¸X1
080-tndtgo .png, the alt set to freecodecamp logo, and the class set to
hero-tmg.

The loading attribute on an img element can be set to lazy to tell the
browser not to fetch the image resource until it is needed (as in, when the
user scrolls the image into view). As an additional benefit, lazy loaded
elements will not load until the non-lazy elements are loaded - this means
users with slow internet connections can view the content of your page
without having to wait for the images to load.
Give your new img element a loading attribute set to lazy.
